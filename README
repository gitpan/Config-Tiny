NAME
    Config::Tiny - Read/Write .ini style files with as little code as
    possible

SYNOPSIS
        # In your configuration file
        rootproperty=blah
    
        [section]
        one=twp
        three=four
        Foo=Bar
        empty=

        # In your program
        use Config::Tiny;

            # Create a config
            my $Config = Config::Tiny->new();

            # Open the config
            $Config = Config::Tiny->read( 'file.conf' );

        # Reading properties
        my $rootproperty = $Config->{_}->{rootproperty};
        my $one = $Config->{section}->{one};
        my $Foo = $Config->{section}->{Foo};

        # Changing data
            $Config->{newsection} = { this => 'that' }; # Add a section
            $Config->{section}->{Foo} = 'Not Bar!';     # Change a value
            delete $Config->{_};                        # Delete a value or section

        # Save a config
        $Config->write( 'file.conf' );

DESCRIPTION
    Config::Tiny is a perl class to read and write .ini style configuration
    files with as little code as possible, reducing load time and memory
    overhead. Memory usage is normally scoffed at in Perl, but in my opinion
    should be at least kept in mind.

    This module is primarily for reading human written files, and anything
    we write shouldn't need to have documentation/comments. If you need
    something with more power, move up to Config::Simple, Config::General or
    one of the many other Config:: modules.

CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX
    Files are the same as windows .ini files, for example.

            [section]
            var1=value1
            var2=value2

    If a property is outside of a section, it will be assigned to the root
    section, available at "$Config-"{_}>.

    Lines starting with '#' or ';' are comments.

    When writing back to the config file, any comments etc are discarded.

METHODS
  new()
    The constructor "new()" creates and returns an empty Config::Tiny
    object.

  read( $filename )
    The "read()" constructor reads a config file, and returns a new
    Config::Tiny object containing the properties in the file. Returns the
    object on success. Returns "undef" on error.

  write()
    The "write( $filename )" generates the file for the properties, and
    writes it to disk. Returns true on success. Returns "undef" on error.

  write_string()
    Generates the file for the object and returns it as a string.

  errstr()
    When an error occurs, you can retrieve the error message either from the
    $Config::Tiny::errstr variable, or using the "errstr()" method.
